# MechSharp

MechSharp is a complete rewrite of [Mechvibes](https://github.com/hainguyents13/mechvibes), app that simulate mechanical keyboard sound on key presses.

MechSharp is written in C# and uses Avalonia UI instead of JavaScript and Electron which should significantly improves performance and reduce memory consumption.

While MechSharp is a complete rewrite of Mechvibes, it does not currently support few features in it such as Soundpack Editor, etc.
